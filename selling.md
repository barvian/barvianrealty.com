# For Sellers

> Selling property? We’ll work hard for your success.

Optimize your property
: We spend most of our time aggressively marketing your home by prospecting for buyers over the phone. This method has the highest rate of effectiveness. We track the number of showings on your home. If you don’t have enough showings, we know the price is too high. If there are few or no showings, the listing price is 10% to high. If there are a lot of showings, but no offers, the listing price is 5% too high. If the property is priced right it will sell within the first eight to ten showings.

Find a pro
: Hiring a real estate agent to work with you is an important decision and will make all the difference in the home buying process. It is essential that you find an agent that listens to what is important to you and openly discusses your ideas, options and the reality of the local real estate market.
