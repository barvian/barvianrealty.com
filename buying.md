# For buyers

> Buying property? We’ll guide you.

Hiring a real estate agent
: Hiring a real estate agent to work with you is an important decision and will make all the difference in the home buying process. It is essential that you find an agent that listens to what is important to you and openly discusses your ideas, options and the reality of the local real estate market.

Our experience
: Understand that I or my team members may not show your home personally. Our Buyer’s team will preview your house to see if it meets the requirements of our current buyers, but please realize that it may not. Our main focus is to market the home to other agents and actively search for buyers.

Our responsibilities
: It is our company policy to represent our clients as single-agents with full fiduciary responsibilities, including the duties of confidentiality, loyalty, obedience, full disclosure, and disclosing all known facts that may materially affect the value.
