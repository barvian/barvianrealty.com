After many years in the banking and financial industry I needed a change. I craved a career that would enable me to help people in a way that would positively impact their lives. I graduated from U-Mass Boston with a B.A. in English and wanted to challenge myself to learn something new - real estate was the ideal choice.

## My Promise
{: .h5}

As your broker I will do everything possible to ensure you are happy and confident in your real estate decisions. Buying OR selling a home can be one of the most stressful times of your life. I strive to smooth out the bumps and make the experience an exciting process rather than a painful one. I am a great listener and will take into account your wish list while we search for the perfect home within your price range. I have a keen sense for design and will help you get your home in the best shape possible for a quick sale.

## My Location

I serve the Will county area including Crest Hill, Naperville, Plainfield, Romeoville, Yorkville and Shorewood. Whether you are looking to buy or sell a home I will put my honesty, integrity and enthusiasm to work for you.
