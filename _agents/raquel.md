I specialize in residential real estate in traditional sales, short sales, foreclosures, investment properties, and new construction. In every sale, I make it personal because I know that it’s not just a house, it’s your home.

As a college graduate of Lewis University (B.S.B.A) with 12+ years of banking and finance experience I am committed to the highest levels of integrity, professionalism, and customer service. I listen to my clients’ needs and goals, and make it my mission to assist them in reaching those goals!

I am a Minooka resident with my husband and three daughters and truly love the community we live in. When I’m not working, I enjoy going thrift shopping, being out and about with my kids, and trying new restaurants.
