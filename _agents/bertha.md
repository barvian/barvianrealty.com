Whether you are a seller or a buyer I am ready to work with you!

I've been in the real estate business since 2004 and have loved every minute. What started as a "part time job" turned out to be my full time career. I have worked with families throughout Will, DuPage, Kane, Kendall and Cook county areas.

When working with buyers I take the necessary time to listen to what they want and need in a home. I then customize their home search to show them only those properties that meet their criteria as closely as possible. I want them to find the perfect home that they can enjoy for years to come.

When working with sellers I want to make sure that they are kept abreast of market conditions to help them make the right decisions throughout the selling process. My goal as a listing agent is to always maximize the selling price and minimize the marketing time......sell homes in the fastest time for the best possible price!

I welcome your calls or emails. I can't wait to get started working with you!!
