testimonials:
  - "We really enjoyed working with Bertha. She is very personable, knowledgeable and made us feel like we were family. She was incredibly patient with us through the entire process. Bertha is also really proactive with sending listings, following up on places you have seen, and super responsive to  any questions or concerns. We would definitely recommend her to all our friends and family, and would call her if we were to buy another home. Thank you for helping my family find our dream home!"
  - "Bertha is an excellent and extremely professional realtor.  She showed me three properties in one day, and because she listened to me about my must haves in the home, the property showed up the same day she was to show me the original two homes I was to view.  I chose the third home.  Bertha made  sure that I stayed in my price range, she explained things to me as a first time home buyer the process of buying a home.  Bertha made me feel comfortable and safe.  Bertha was with me through the entire process, even checking in with me for the closing.  I felt and knew that I was in very capable hands with Bertha.  I have already referred her to several of my co-workers, friends, and family."
  - "I had the privilege of working with Bertha as my realtor when looking to purchase a house in Illinois. Bertha was very thorough and professional. She was always there to help and support me in every possible way. I really appreciate how Bertha were on top of things and how she kept me informed  every step of the way. She was always diligent, responsive, and yet very patient. Me and my wife found Bertha to be a highly attentive agent, almost as if we were her only customers!"
  - "Bertha is very hard working, helpful, knowledgeable, communicative, and friendly. She not only sold our house in record time, but she put in the extra effort to ensure we had a respectable buyer, so our time wasn't wasted. This was the third time we tried to sell our house. The first two times were  failures, so we switch agents and began working with Bertha. One would say third time lucky, but I say luck had nothing to do with it. It's all because of Bertha and I'll definitely be selling any other homes with her in the future. She really looked out for us and was sensitive to our needs."

Whether you are a seller or a buyer I am ready to work with you!

I've been in the real estate business since 2004 and have loved every minute. What started as a "part time job" turned out to be my full time career. I have worked with families throughout Will, DuPage, Kane, Kendall and Cook county areas.

When working with buyers I take the necessary time to listen to what they want and need in a home. I then customize their home search to show them only those properties that meet their criteria as closely as possible. I want them to find the perfect home that they can enjoy for years to come.

When working with sellers I want to make sure that they are kept abreast of market conditions to help them make the right decisions throughout the selling process. My goal as a listing agent is to always maximize the selling price and minimize the marketing time......sell homes in the fastest time for the best possible price!

I welcome your calls or emails. I can't wait to get started working with you!!
