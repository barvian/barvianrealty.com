I have specialized in residential real estate for buyers and sellers in Will county and the surrounding areas since 1998. As a licensed Illinois Realtor and multi-million dollar producer I pride myself in client communication. Continuing education and certifications such as ABR, SFR and ePRO have aided me in ensuring that your real estate transaction is a smooth one!
