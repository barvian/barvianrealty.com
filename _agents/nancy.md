My experience with Nancy, from initial conversation regarding my unique and changing wants, to the final closing was a very satisfying journey. Nancy was accommodating to my requests and displayed a keen assessment and follow-through in regard to the homes on my “want to see list”. From the time we put an offer in, to the closing, she kept me informed of my status and my “to do list”.  Nancy Gibson is a caring, concerned and extremely knowledgeable person who I was fortunate to have as my agent. I would strongly recommend Nancy to serve your real estate needs."

  - "Nancy is very thorough and takes pride in helping you to sell your house. Our buyer was a nightmare, and Nancy went above and beyond to help get information and work with our attorney.  She even came out herself to take pictures of our pool when we wanted it on the listing. You can trust that she will work hard to help you sell your home fast. Ours sold in 5 days with 3 offers."

I specialize in residential real estate -- traditional sales, short sales, foreclosures, investment properties, and new construction. In every sale, I make it personal because I know that it’s not just a house, it’s your home.

As a million-dollar+ producer, I am committed to the highest levels of integrity, professionalism, and customer service. I listen to my clients’ needs and goals, and educate my clients on the home buying or selling process. My goal is to keep a client for life.

I reside in Plainfield with my husband and daughter, and believe that family life is a solid base that ensures success in my career. When I'm not working I enjoy reading, working in my garden, and horseback riding.
