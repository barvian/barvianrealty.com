I specialize in residential real estate -- traditional sales, short sales, foreclosures, investment properties, and new construction. In every sale, I make it personal because I know that it’s not just a house, it’s your home.

As a million-dollar+ producer, I am committed to the highest levels of integrity, professionalism, and customer service. I listen to my clients’ needs and goals, and educate my clients on the home buying or selling process. My goal is to keep a client for life.

I reside in Plainfield with my husband and daughter, and believe that family life is a solid base that ensures success in my career. When I'm not working I enjoy reading, working in my garden, and horseback riding.
