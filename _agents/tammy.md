With over 17 years of full-time experience, I specialize in residential real estate in
traditional sales, short sales, foreclosures and auctions. My husband and I have bought,
built, renovated and sold eight of our own personal homes. With my combined personal
and professional experience, I truly understand the opportunities and challenges of buying
and selling a home. In every sale, I make it personal because I know that it’s not just a
house, it’s someone’s home.

As a multi-million- dollar producer, I am committed to the highest levels of integrity,
professionalism, and customer service. I listen to my clients’ needs and goals, and educate
them on the home buying or selling process. My goal is to keep a client for life.
I enjoy serving on the Board of Directors and am an active member of the Plainfield
Chamber of Commerce, the Village Preservation Association, Women You Should Know, the
International Women’s Leadership Association, and a committee member for the Plainfield
Hometown Irish Parade. I have earned The Hearld News’s “#1 Realtor in Will County” award
in 2016, and Chicago Magazine’s “5-Star Agent” award every year from 2011 to 2017. I have certifications in Home Staging and Distressed Properties, and am a certified Negotiation Expert.

I am a dedicated wife, and a mother of identical twin boys. My family and I reside in
downtown Plainfield. When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my family,
running, being outdoors, and reading.
